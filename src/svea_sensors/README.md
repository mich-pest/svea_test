### Supported Sensors

The package includes launch files, transforms, dependencies etc. for the
following sensors:

- **`ZED mini`**
  Stereo camera for visual odometry. Publish rate 15-100 Hz depending on
  resolution. Note that the transform for the ZED is set in
  [urdf/zedm.urdf](urdf/zedm.urdf), and not in
  [luanch/transforms.launch](luanch/transforms.launch).

- **`Intel Realsense T265`**
  Stereo camera for visual odometry. Publish rate 200 Hz (visual odometry at
  about 30 Hz integrated with IMU data).

- **`IMU`**
  BNO055, 9 degrees of freedom IMU. Publish rate ca 100 Hz. (Can also give
  temperature)

- **`Hokuyo UST-10LX`**
  2D lidar with a publish rate of 40 Hz. Connected through ethernet.

- **`Wheel encoders`**
  The wheel encoders are a prototype and not available on most SVEAs. The
  software required for using a pair of encoders is however included in this
  package.


## Installation

The package should be downloaded and used as a part of the `svea` package.

The *Hokuyo UST-10LX*, *Realsense T265*, and *ZED mini* requires special
installation steps.

**Note:** After installing the package you will have to enable additional
hardware permisions inorder to connect to the sensors. Do this by running

    roscd svea_sensors
    sudo bash grant_hardware_permisions.sh

and then restar the computer.

### Building from Source

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your
catkin workspace and compile the package using

```
cd catkin_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/KTH-SML/svea_research
cd ../
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
catkin build
```


### ZED mini camera installation

- Install the ZED SDK according to the
  [ZED SDK install instructions](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/installation/jetson/#download-and-install-the-zed-sdk).

- Install the [ZED ROS wrapper](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper#build-the-program).

### Realsense T265 installation

These instructions are for installing the Intel Realsense T265 camera on a
Nvidia Jetson. The default package that can be downloaded with `apt-get` have
some bugs on the Jetson computers. Instead the packages will have to be
installed from jetsonhacks, and the ROS package will have to be cloned from
github. Start by adding the jetsonhacks repository with:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key F6E65AC044F831AC80A06380C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE || sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://realsense-hw-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Debian/apt-repo bionic main" -u
```

Note that `bionic` might have to be replaced if the ubuntu version switches
from 18.

Then install the required realsense packages with

```
sudo apt-get install apt-utils -y
sudo apt-get install librealsense2-utils librealsense2-dev -y
```

The ROS realsense repo can then be cloned (and checked out to the correct
tag) into your `[workspace_name]/src` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros.git
cd realsense-ros/
git checkout 2.2.16
```

In Jetpack opencv is installed in `/usr/include;/usr/include/opencv4`
instead of `/usr/include/opencv` where ROS (more specifically `cv_bridge`)
will look for it. Fix this by adding a symlink to the correct dirctory with

```
sudo ln -s /usr/include/opencv4 /usr/include/opencv
```

Run `rosdep` to make sure that all dependencies are installed.

```
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

And finally build and source the workspace.

```
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

### Hokuyo UST-10LX installation

The ethernet interface to which the lidar is connected has to be set to a manual IP, within the same range as the lidar. For example: if the lidar's IP is `192.168.3.11` the ethernet interface on the Jetson should be set to something like

```
IP: 192.168.3.10
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
```

## Usage

Start the self localization with

```
roslaunch svea_sensors localize.launch rviz:=true
```

Rviz should started and display the position of the vehicle. In addition,
odometry for the vehicle in the *odom* frame of reference will be published
on `odometry/filtered`, and the same information translated to the *map*
frame will be published on `odometry/corrected`.


## Launch files

- **localize.launch:** Starts the sensors, static transforms, the
  localization node, and the pose transformation node.

## Nodes

### bnoo055_i2c_node

This is a ROS node for the BNO055 IMU that communicates via I2C and without
any dependencies besides libi2c-dev. It does **not** require RTIMULib,
RTIMULib2, RTIMULib3 or whatever the latest sequel is. It is specifically
targeted at using a BNO055 with NVIDIA boards such as the TX1, TX2, and
Xavier, or any other board that has native I2C.

The BNO055 supports I2C and UART communication. This driver supports I2C
only. If you are looking for a UART driver, see
[this driver](https://github.com/mdrwiega/bosch_imu_driver)
by [mdrwiega](https://github.com/mdrwiega) instead.

#### Published Topics

- **`data`** ([sensor_msgs/Imu])

    Acceleration, angular velocity and orientation.
    The orientation is calculated by integrating the angular velocity
    onboard the BNO055. The BNNO055 is not configured to include magnetometer
    readings due to the inherent problems with magnetometers. The orintation
    is therefore relative to the orientation when the BNO055 was started.

- **`raw`** ([sensor_msgs/Imu])

    Un-corrected acceleration and angular velocity.
    The acceleration is not corrected by the BNO055 self calibration, hwever
    it appears to still be heavily filtered. The angular velocity is the same
    as published on the *data* topic.

- **`mag`** ([sensor_msgs/MagneticField])

    The current magnetic field reading.

- **`temp`** ([sensor_msgs/Temperature])

    The temperature measured by the BNO055.

#### Parameters

- **`rate`** (int, default: 400)

    Rate that the BNO055 will be pooled at.
    Data will only be published if any of the values has changed compared to
    the last published values. The BNO055 supports a maximum rate of 100 Hz.
    A higher rate decreases the delay of that reading.

- **`device`** (string, default: "/dev/i2c-1")

    Path to the i2c device. Default is /dev/i2c-1. Use i2cdetect in the
    i2c-tools package to find out which bus your IMU is on. For a TX2 this is
    usually `"/dev/i2c-2"` and for the Xavier AGX it is usually `"/dev/i2c-8"`.

- **`address`** (int, default: 0x28)

    i2c address of the IMU.

- **`frame_id`** (string, default: "imu")

    The frame id used in published messages.


### odom_to_map

A node that translate odometry messages published in an odom frame onto a map
based on a transform from e. g. AMCL.

#### Subscribed Topics

- **`odometry/filtered`** ([nav_msgs/Odometry])

    Topic for the odometry messages that will be translated.


#### Published Topics

- **`state`** ([svea_msgs/VehicleState])

    Kinematic bicycle state of the vehicle in the map frame.

- **`odometry/corrected`** ([nav_msgs/Odometry])

    Odometry of the vehicle in the map frame.

- **`pose`** ([geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped])

    Pose of the vehicle in the map frame.


#### Parameters

- **`map_frame`** (stricng, default: "map")

    Frame of reference that the odometry messages should be translated to.

- **`wait_for_transform`** (bool, default: false)

    If set to *false* the last received transform sill be used to translate
    an odometry message. If *true* the node will wait for the next transform.
    Waiting for the transform will cause a delay, but could allow higher
    accuracy since an  interpolation between two transformes can be used for
    the translation.

- **`publish_odometry`** (bool, default: true)

    Set to false to stop publishing odometry messages.

- **`publish_pose`** (bool, default: true)

    Set to false to stop publishing pose messages.


### actuation_to_twist

Approximates the current velocity based on the actuated throttle.
The calculation accounts for the current gear and acceleration characteristics of the vehicle. The velocity is published at a fixed rate, using zero order hold interpolation. That is, the last received message is assumed to be in effect until the next message is received.

#### Subscribed Topics

- **`lli/encoder`** ([svea_msgs/lli_encoder])

    Raw encoder data that is used to calculate the velocity.

#### Published Topics

- **`actuation_twist`** ([geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovarianceStamped])
